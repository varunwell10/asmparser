# asmparser

This is my first python project. Primary goal is to get accustmed with python environment, and secondary goal is to build something which has possibility of resuse in my next python project.

This project tries to identify the CPU ISA set used by compiler to generate asm code from high level languages (e.g. C/C++).
It produces statistical data.

Method:

1. Project takes compiler generated assembly files as input.
2. Project parses the assembly file (using basic lexical analysis - to start with)
3. Project publishes set of ISAs used for the assembly file.

P.S. : Any Contributions back to repo are appreciated.
