# asmparser

This is my first python project. Primary goal is to get accustmed with python environment, and secondary goal is to build something which has possibility of resuse in my next python project.

This project tries to identify the CPU ISA set used by compiler to generate asm code from high level languages (e.g. C/C++).
It produces statistical data.
